## Methods in Java

### What is a Method?

- A method is used to perform a certain task
- Collection of instructions that performs a specific task
- Provides code readability and reusability
- Example: A `sum()` method takes arguments and returns the addition of numbers

### Method Declaration Syntax

```java
AccessSpecifier ReturnType MethodName(Arguments) throws Exception {
    // method body
}

// Example:
public int sum(int a, int b) throws Exception {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Access Specifiers

Defines accessibility of a method (who can use it):

1. **Public**: Can be accessed through any class in any package
2. **Private**: Can only be accessed by methods in the same class
3. **Protected**: Can be accessed by other classes in same package or subclasses in different packages
4. **Default**: Can only be accessed by classes in same package (used when no specifier is mentioned)

### Return Type

- Tells what type the method will return after computation
- If the method doesn't return anything, `void` return type is used
- Can use class names or primitive data types as return type

### Method Name

- Should be a verb (some kind of action)
- Should start with a small letter
- Follow camelCase convention for multiple words

### Method Parameters

- A list of variables that will be used in the method
- Parameter list can be blank too

### Method Body

- Method body finishes when you call `return`
- Gets finished when reached to the end
- Can use `return` to stop method even for void return type

## Types of Methods

### 1. System Defined Methods

- Methods which are already defined and ready to use in Java
- Example: `Math.sqrt()`

### 2. User Defined Methods

- Methods which the programmer creates based upon program necessity

### 3. Overloaded Methods

- More than one method with same name in the same class
- Differentiated based on arguments only
- Same name, different arguments
- Return type is not considered for differentiation

### 4. Overridden Methods

- Subclass/Child class has the same method as the parent class

### 5. Static Methods

- Associated with the class
- Can be called with class name
- Cannot access non-static instance variables and methods
- Cannot be overridden

**When to declare methods static:**

- Methods which do not modify the state of the object
- Utility methods which do not use any instance variable and compute only on arguments
- Example: Factory design pattern

### 6. Final Methods

- Cannot be overridden in Java
- Final method means its implementation cannot be changed
- If child class cannot change implementation, there's no use of overriding

### 7. Abstract Methods

- Defined only in abstract classes
- Only method declaration is done
- Implementation is done in child classes

### Variable Arguments (Varargs)

- Variable number of inputs in the parameter
- Only one variable argument can be present in the method
- Must be the last argument in the list
- Used when we don't know the number of arguments

```java
public void method(int... numbers) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int num : numbers){
	    sum+=num;
    }
}
```

## Constructors in Java

### What is a Constructor?

- Used to create an instance (initialize the instance variables)
- Similar to method except:
    - **Name**: Constructor name is same as class name
    - **Return Type**: Constructor does not have any return type
    - **Modifiers**: Constructor cannot be static, final, abstract, or synchronized

### The `new` Keyword

- Tells Java to call the constructor

### Constructor Rules and Restrictions

#### Why constructor name is same as class name?

- Easy to identify
- No return type because implicitly Java adds class as return type

#### Why constructor does not have return type?

- There can be methods with same name and even class as return type
- They cannot be called constructors as they don't obey the rules (same name without return type)

#### Why constructor cannot be final?

- Constructors are different from usual methods and cannot be inherited
- Doesn't make sense to make them final (final prevents overriding)
- If constructors cannot be inherited, there's no requirement for final

#### Why constructor cannot be abstract?

- Abstract methods require implementation in child class
- Constructors can't be inherited, so no point in making them abstract

#### Why constructor cannot be static?

- Static methods can only access static variables and other static methods
- Won't be able to initialize instance variables
- Won't be able to use constructor chaining or call `super()`

#### Can we define constructor in interface?

- No, because we cannot create objects from interfaces
- No point of constructor without object creation

## Types of Constructors

### 1. Default Constructor

- When we do not define a constructor, Java internally provides one
- Sets default values for all instance variables
- Added only when we don't define any constructor

### 2. No-Argument Constructor

- Constructor that does not take any argument
- Very similar to default constructor but we define it instead of Java

### 3. Parameterized Constructors

- Takes arguments and assigns instance variables with those parameters
- Can initialize one or multiple instance variables
- Variables without arguments are instantiated with default values

### 4. Constructor Overloading

- Can create multiple constructors with different parameters

### 5. Private Constructor

- No one outside the class can call the constructor
- Used in Singleton design pattern
- To create object with private constructor:
    - Create another static method to create the object
    - Call that method using class name

---

## Constructor Chaining

Constructor chaining means calling one constructor from another constructor.

### Using `this()`

- Used to chain a constructor within the same class

```java
class Example {
    Example() {
        this(10); // Calls parameterized constructor
    }
    
    Example(int x) {
        // Constructor body
    }
}
```

### Using `super()`

- Constructor of child class always invokes parent class constructor first
- Then invokes its own constructor
- If we don't explicitly add `super()`, Java adds it internally
- If parent class has parameterized constructor, must mandatorily pass argument to `super()` to call parent's parameterized constructor

```java
class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super(); // Calls parent constructor (added by Java if not explicit)
        // Child constructor body
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- `this()` and `super()` are used for constructor chaining
- Must be the first statement in constructor
- Cannot use both in the same constructor
