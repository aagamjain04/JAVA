In Java, **a source file can contain only one `public` class**, and the **filename must match** that class name.

Example:


```java
// File: Student.java
public class Student {
    // class body
}

```


- Java compiler (`javac`) expects a **1:1 mapping** between the filename and the public class name.
- It simplifies **class loading and identification**, as the JVM can directly locate the `.class` file by name.
- If multiple public classes were allowed, the compiler wouldn't know **which class name should define the file name**.
- A `public` class is **accessible from anywhere**, so defining multiple in one file could create **namespace confusion**.
- Non-public (default/package-private) classes can still exist in the same file for **helper purposes**.
